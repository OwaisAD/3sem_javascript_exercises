// EXERCISE 1

// A1) Data types in JS are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined and null. We refer to them as primitive types.

// A2) Undefined variable means a variable has been declared but it does not have a value. Undeclared variable means that the variable does not exist in the program at all.

// A3) Single line is //, multiline /**/, function comment /**... */

// A4) Does JavaScript support automatic type conversion? Yes. It's usually called type coercion, but conversion is perfectly accurate.

// A5) https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strict.asp Strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors. Strict mode fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode. You use it by writing "use strict"
